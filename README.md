# Description :
This project showcases how to integrate external APIs and visualize data using Python. Specifically, it connects to the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve historical daily stock data for Google (GOOGL) and creates a line chart of its closing prices. The workflow involves sending an API request, processing the returned JSON data, and generating a time-series plot using data visualization libraries
- Functionality Overview:
 *API Integration:
Connects to the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve full daily stock price data.
The symbol variable allows users to specify the company ticker (here, GOOGL).
*Data Extraction and Processing:
Checks if the API response contains valid data.
Converts the nested JSON structure into a pandas DataFrame.
Transforms string-based date indices into datetime format.
Extracts the closing price and converts it to a numeric data type.
*Data Visualization:
Uses Matplotlib to generate a line plot of Googleâ€™s stock closing prices over time.
Includes labeled axes and a title for clarity.
